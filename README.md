While running, @RWplotbot bot receives tweets via mentions and in turn performs sentiment analysis on the most recent twitter account specified in the mention. For example, when a user tweets, "@RWplotbot Analyze: @CNN," it will trigger a sentiment analysis on the CNN twitter feed. Example sentiment analysis graphs attached as PNGs.
